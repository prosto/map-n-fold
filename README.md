# map-n-fold

## Important Notes

1. I have not used C# and .NET for almost 8 years. So this is my attempt to make it look right :)
2. I later noticed in coding style guides suggestion to use code contracts for null checking (e.g. letting compiler do some null checking work). In my case I'm just checking manually for nulls in both Map and Fold
3. Not thread safe
